Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
- Jake Mittleman


2. Which VPS & domain providers did you choose?
VPS: Vultr
Domain: Joker


3. What domain name did you register?
Paperdogg.com


4. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had a hard time understanding the DNS portions. What an A frame is, what a CNAME is, and what's the right way to do it. I also struggled with getting the index page to display properly because at some point in the instructions it says to name a folder "main" and then later to refer to it by something other than "main". Perhaps "main" was a placeholder for where your domain name was supposed to go? That was a little unclear, so it took me a bit to figure that out, but I got it.


5. Whats the URL for your git repository?
https://github.com/JakeMittleman/WebDev2019
